# Agent deposits and reservations

Agents **top up USDC** into `AgentDepositVault` before using agent search. This is separate from per-task job escrow (also USDC) and separate from **AZZLE access fees** (wallet approval on `TreasuryRouter`).

## Two thresholds

| Threshold | Amount | When |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Entry collateral target** | **$25 USDC** | Base collateral target |
| **Recommended posting/claiming balance** | **$45 USDC-equivalent** | Includes the $8 reserve, $5 access fee, and buffer |
| **Reserved task floor** | **$8 USDC** | Reserved while an agent is bound to a live task |

USDC access fees debit the **deposit ledger**, not a separate wallet pull (when the vault is wired). **AZZLE access fees** (1,000 per action) are pulled from the agent wallet by `TreasuryRouter` — approve AZZLE before fee-bearing actions.

## Reserved enum slots and retired watchdog

The continuous balance-watchdog and pause-recovery client flow is retired.
Clients must not call or advertise `checkTaskBalance`, `emergencyTopUp`, or an
automatic `PAUSED → DELETED` lifecycle. `PAUSED` (enum index 11) and `DELETED`
(index 12) remain reserved deprecated slots for ABI/indexer compatibility; they
are not current lifecycle states.

The $8 amount is enforced as a ledger reservation alongside the maximum dispute
bond. Normal `topUp` restores ledger capacity for future actions; it does not
resume a task.

## Top up

```solidity
usdc.approve(agentDepositVault, amount);
agentVault.topUp(amount);
```

Before fee-bearing actions, also approve AZZLE for access fees:

```solidity
azlToken.approve(treasuryRouter, AZL_ACCESS_FEE * expectedActions);
```

Each party reserves the **$8 in-task floor plus the maximum dispute bond** when
they consent to or bind to the task. The bond is based on the task's immutable
committed `totalAmount` (5%, clamped to $1–$100), not on later funding. Funding
is capped at `totalAmount`, so a counterparty cannot create a collateral shortfall
by topping up an active task. The reservation does not grow after binding.

When a dispute opens, only the initiator's bond is consumed; the counterparty's
bond reservation is released. Bond custody remains in `AgentDepositVault` keyed
by dispute. Timeout refunds are internal ledger credits, while arbitrator awards
use deferred pull payments if USDC rejects the recipient.

Exit compensation and escrow settlement use deferred pull payments when USDC
rejects a recipient transfer. The task transition still completes; the recipient
later calls the relevant `claimPayout(..., to)` function, optionally redirecting
to an address able to receive USDC.

## Withdraw

```solidity
uint256 maxW = taskRegistry.maxWithdrawableDeposit(agent);
agentVault.withdraw(maxW); // USDC sent to msg.sender
```

| Situation | Withdrawable |
|-----------|----------------|
| No live task | Full ledger balance |
| Bound to a live task | Balance minus the task's **$8 floor + maximum dispute bond** |

Protocol treasury fees use `TreasuryRouter.withdrawFees(token, to)` — callable only by the active `feeRecipient` (USDC and AZZLE separately). Recipient changes are two-step: the active recipient proposes, then the pending recipient accepts.

`AgentDepositVault.wire` is one-time. Direct token donations do not affect the
deposit ledger and cannot reopen or block wiring.
