# AZZLE × Base MCP

Use this skill when the user wants to **post, claim, fund, or operate AZZLE tasks** on Base through their Base Account.

## Prerequisites

1. **Base MCP** connected (`base-mcp` at `https://mcp.base.org`) — run its onboarding every session (`get_wallets`, disclaimer). Load the `base-mcp` skill if installed.
2. **AZZLE MCP** connected (local `agents/mcp/server.mjs`) — Base RPC V2 discovery tools.
3. **`cd agents && npm run build`** — required for the prepare CLI and AZZLE MCP.

## Plugin

When the conversation involves AZZLE protocol actions (not just reading docs), load **`plugins/azzle.md`** from this skill directory (local read first; web fallback: `https://www.azzle.org/reference/agents/mcp/skills/azzle/plugins/azzle.md`).

Follow that file for:

- Read path → azzle MCP + `prepare-tx.mjs read`
- Prepare path → `npm run mcp:prepare -- <action> --from <address> …` (run from `agents/`)
- Write path → Base MCP `send_calls` + approval-mode polling

## Quick routing

| User intent | Read | Prepare | Execute |
|-------------|------|---------|---------|
| What's open? | `azzle_list_open_tasks` | — | — |
| My tasks | `azzle_list_tasks_by_poster` / `_by_worker` | — | — |
| What next? | `azzle_task_next_steps` | — | — |
| Am I ready? | `prepare-tx read` | — | — |
| Onboard deposit ledger | `prepare-tx read` | Use `paymentGateway` after its pause check | `send_calls` |
| Claim task | `azzle_get_task` | `claim` | `send_calls` |
| Post to market | — | `post` (+ batched `publish-scope` when open) | `send_calls` |
| Update scope | `scopeOf` via read RPC | `publish-scope` | `send_calls` |

**Open vs private discovery:** [`protocol/TASK_DISCOVERY.md`](../../../protocol/TASK_DISCOVERY.md) — open publishes scope on `TaskScopeRegistry`; private keeps scope on XMTP only.
| Deliver + settle | `azzle_task_next_steps` | `mark-delivered` → `release` / `complete` | `send_calls` |
| Negotiate off-chain context | `azzle_build_xmtp_proposal` | `build-task-preview` | `post` → `claim` → `fund` |
| Verify preview | `azzle_verify_task_preview_hash` | — | — |
| Dispute | `azzle_task_next_steps` | `open-dispute` → arbitration prepares | `send_calls` |
| Need AZZLE | Base MCP balance | `swap` | `send_calls` / swap approval |

Every write returns `{ approvalUrl, requestId }` — never skip user approval.

## Addresses

Only [`contracts/deployments/base-8453.json`](../../../deployments/base-8453.json) — never infer from memory.
